# Not Hotdog Image Classifier

## Overview
This project sorts images into two categories: **Hotdog** and **Other**, using a TensorFlow model trained with Google's Teachable Machine. It moves images into their respective directories based off of output from the model.

## Directory Structure
```
Testing/                # Base folder (user must create)
│── To_Sort/           # Unsorted images go here
│── Hotdog/            # Hotdog images are moved here
│── Other/             # Non-hotdog images are moved here
```

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```
pip install tensorflow pillow
```

## Files
### `Classifier.py`
Contains the function `classify_image(image_path)`, which:
- Loads the trained TensorFlow model (`keras_Model.h5`).
- Reads class labels from `labels.txt`.
- Loads and formats an image (image_path)
- Predicts whether the image is a **Hotdog** or **Not a Hotdog**.
- Returns `True` if the image is a hotdog, and `False` if not.

### `main.py`
Handles image classification and sorting:
- Takes the base directory path from the user.
- Processes all images in `To_Sort/`.
- Moves images classified as **Hotdog** to `Hotdog/`.
- Moves other images to `Other/`.
- Prints out each file move.

## Usage
1. Place images to be classified in the `Testing/To_Sort/` directory.
2. Run `main.py`:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
3. 
3. The script will classify and move images to the appropriate folders.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure `keras_Model.h5` and `labels.txt` are in the same directory as `Classifier.py`.
- Double-check that `To_Sort/`, `Hotdog/`, and `Other/` directories exist.
- If `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PIL'` occurs, install `pillow`:
  ```
  pip install pillow
  ```
